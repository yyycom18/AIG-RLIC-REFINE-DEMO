In GitHub Desktop you must open THIS folder (AIG-RLIC-REFINE-DEMO), not the parent "Cursor" folder.

Correct path to add:
  C:\Users\user\Desktop\Cursor\AIG-RLIC-REFINE-DEMO

Steps:
1. In GitHub Desktop: File → Remove (remove the current "Cursor" repo from the list).
2. File → Add local repository.
3. Click "Choose..." and go to the folder that CONTAINS this file (AIG-RLIC-REFINE-DEMO).
4. Click "Add repository". You should then see 1 commit and no "AIG-RLIC-REFINE-DEMO/" untracked.
5. Push origin to publish.
